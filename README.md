## TODO

- Validate and sanitize form input.

- Enforce extension to open only one tab at a time

- Get some feedback after submitting. Success or why it failed.

- Allow "People" (first name, last name, RedID, SDSU email) to be stored for easy reselect later. Should use sync storage for convenience.
