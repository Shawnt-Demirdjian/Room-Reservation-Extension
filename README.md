## TODO

- Enforce extention to open only one tab at a time

- Add functionality for user to specify content of form submit.

- Get some feedback after submiting. Success or why it failed.

- Allow "People" (first name, last name, RedID, SDSU email) to be stored for easy reselect later. Should use sync storage for convenience.
